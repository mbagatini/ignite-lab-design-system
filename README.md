# üìò About this project

The purpose of this project was to build a design system from scratch, from designing it on Figma until building UI components documentation with Storybook. 

This project brings the design area closer to front-end development, using React. This is a bootcamp promoted by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br).

Check more details about it below.

### Why use a Design System?

Creating a Design System not only helps your team produce more consistent user experiences, it bridges the gap between design and development. 
By creating a common codified visual language and a set of components and templates cataloged in a UI library, you‚Äôll dramatically improve communication between all project stakeholders, whether it‚Äôs designers, the marketing team, developers or your end customers.

Summarizing:
- It creates a unified language within and across teams.
- It creates visual consistency across (potentially siloed) products, channels and services.
- It can serve as an educational and reference tool for lower level designers and content contributors (copywriters, media producers‚Ä¶).
